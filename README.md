## Overview

I developed this project while working at [Column Five Media](https://www.columnfivemedia.com) in 2014 for our client, FTSE. The purpose of the interactive infographic was to educate investors on the pending liberalization of the Chinese equities market (circa 2014). A part of this project I really enjoyed was coding up the interactive dials from scratch. These simple widgets look great and have a clean animation that brings additional visual interest to the user and helps while conveying the changed scenario.

## How it Works

This interactive was fairly straight forward. Clicking on different tabs at the top switches between different scenarios that are defined in a JSON data model. When a scenario is updated, the dials below animate accordingly and the indication of where China would fall in the global equities market for the given scenario is updated. The interactive makes use of a powerful data visualization duo: D3.js and Knockout.js.
